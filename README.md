# VesselNet:  An Efficient Deep Learning Framework to Segment Blood Vessels from Color Fundus Image

## DESCRIPTION

Glaucoma is a group of eye conditions that damage the optic nerve, the health of which is vital for good vision. This damage is often caused by an abnormally high pressure in your eye. Early detection of this condition is important for it's treatment.

One way of detecting this disease is through Blood Vessel Segmentation. It is found that one of the symptoms of Glaucoma is huge branching of blood vessel in the fundus of the eyes, than the normal. Detecting the number of branches of a blood vessel in the eye can help know if the patient is prone to Glaucoma, beforehand.

Blood Vessel Segmentation has gained significant recognition in the medical image processing. Many ML and deep learning models have been introduced to efficiently detect blood vessel. VesselNet is one such model.

The VesselNet is inspired from the general Unet model along with the Bottleneck Attention Modules (BAM).
